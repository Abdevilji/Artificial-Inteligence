Here we will see the training of a network.
MLPs are trained using algorithms like backpropagation, where the network learns to adjust the weights of connections between nodes to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs.
Challenges: MLPs may suffer from overfitting, especially with small datasets or inadequate regularization. Tuning hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers and nodes can be challenging.
Overall, MLPs are a fundamental and versatile architecture in AI, forming the basis for many advanced neural network models.
